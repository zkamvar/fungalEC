# EC

Understanding fungicide dose response is an essential for management of plant pathogens. The EC50 is a standard statistic for evaluating all dose response relationships. Estimating EC50 may not be as trivial for some people. "EC" is written for generating EC50 of fungal and oomycete dose response data accuratly and quickly for the phytopathology community.
